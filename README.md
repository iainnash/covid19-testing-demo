# COVID-19 Testing Site Finder with Risk Assessment

## What we built
A static site for users to take a COVID-19 risk assessment or search for testing site locations. 
Key components of the site include:
- A COVID-19 risk assessment
- A simple ETL for ingesting testing site data from a `.csv` file
- A user experience to search for testing sites by location (including a map view) and view testing site-specific detail 
- A recommendation engine to recommend testing window slots at each testing site
- A confirmation page to surface any critical information to prepare the user for testing
